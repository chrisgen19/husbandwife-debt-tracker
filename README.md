- **Seed database**: `npm run db:seed`

## Notes

- Currency is displayed in Philippine Peso (â‚±) with comma formatting
- Data is persisted in PostgreSQL database
- In production, use proper password hashing (bcrypt, argon2) and session management
- Consider using environment variables for different database connections (dev/prod)
